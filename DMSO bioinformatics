## bioinformatic commands used on our dataset.  These were used on each pair of FASTQ files

## cutadapt was used to trim adapters from reads.
cutadapt flu0_R1.fastq.gz flu0_R2.fastq.gz -m 25 -n 2 -j 4 -o flu0_R1.trimmed.fastq.gz -p flu0_R2.trimmed.fastq.gz \

## Sickle was used to trim for quality
sickle pe -f flu0_R1.trimmed.fastq.gz -r flu0_R2.trimmed.fastq.gz -t sanger -o flu0_R1.qc.fastq.gz -p flu0_R2.qc.fastq.gz -s flu0.qcsingles.fastq.gz.fastq -n
	
done

## PEAR was used to merge paired end reads.  This command was repeated for each set of paired fastq files
PEAR -f flu0_R1.qc.fastq.gz -r flu0_R2.qc.fastq.gz -n 25 -o flu0.merged

## bowtie2 was used to index the reference genomes
bowtie2-build influenza.fasta flu_ref

## reads were mapped to the reference genomes with bowtie 2
bowtie2 -x flu_ref -U flu0.merged.assembled.fastq -S flu0.mapped.SAM 

## SAM files were converted to BAM, sorted, and indexed
samtools view -bS flu0.mapped.SAM > flu0.mapped.BAM
samtools sort flu0.mapped.BAM -o flu0.mapped.sorted.BAM
samtools index flu0.mapped.sorted.BAM

## bam-readcount was used to determine the read depth at each position
bam-readcount -b 20 flu0.mapped.sorted.BAM > flu0.txt
